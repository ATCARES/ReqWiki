	abstract = {The requirements engineering phase within a software project is a heavily knowledge driven, collaborative process that typically involves the analysis and creation of a large number of textual artifacts. We know that requirements engineering has a large impact on the success of a project, yet sophisticated tool support, especially for small to mid-size enterprises, is still lacking. We present ReqWiki, a novel open source web-based approach based on a semantic wiki that includes Natural Language Processing (NLP) assistants, which work collaboratively with humans on the requirements specification documents. },

	abstract = {We present a novel architecture for the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities into wiki systems. The vision is that of a new generation of wikis that can help developing their own primary content and organize their structure by using state-of-the-art technologies from the NLP and Semantic Computing domains. The motivation for this integration is to enable wiki users -- novice or expert -- to benefit from modern text mining techniques directly within their wiki environment.  We implemented these ideas based on MediaWiki and present a number of real-world application case studies that illustrate the practicability and effectiveness of this approach.},
