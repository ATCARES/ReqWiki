ReqWiki
=======

ReqWiki is a novel open source web-based approach for software requirements engineering. It is based on a semantic wiki that includes natural language processing (NLP) assistants, which work collaboratively with humans on the requirements specification documents. It is the first Requirements Engineering tool that combines wiki technology for collaborative use and semantic knowledge representation for formal queries and reasoning with natural language processing assistants within a single, cohesive interface.
